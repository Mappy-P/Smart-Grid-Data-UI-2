          <p style = 'padding-bottom: 30px;'>As our P&O3-engineering project at the KU Leuven, we choose to work around Smart Grid Data. In this project we're being given a demand response problem.
            The problem requires us to create an algorithm that efficiently charges cars, that are parked at EnergyVille, a company that specialises in research for sustainable energy.
             The company has a lot of solar panels. These solar panels supply a lot of green energy that we want to utilize as much as possible for charging electrical cars.
              In order for us to create an efficient algorithm, we have to first predict the amount of incoming solar energy. This is made possible via machine learning (deep learning)</p>

                    <p > Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models capable of learning from data.
                    These are clever systems that can recognize certain patterns that humans most of the times can't see. Machine learning has various applications, 
                    from image recognition and language processing to time-series forecasting which we are going to use it for.

            The "naive" strategy charges the cars immediately when they arrive and it stops when their battery is at the desired capacity.
             This method may be suited for usage in a single-car household, but not in a situation where there are multiple cars to be charged. 
             On the left graph we see the direct charging method, there's a significant peak in the morning's power usage, when all the employees arrive at the company and start charging their cars.
            As you may realize, there's not a lot of sun shining in the morning, thus the company will need to purchase electricity from the grid.
          The graph at the right side shows a way of charging where the peak in power usage is spread throughout the day and more concentrated at noon. At that moment the sun shines the brightest.

            We've made a demo for you to use and see the difference between "naive" charging and our way of "smart" charging. With "naive" we mean charging the cars immediately, without considering the possibility of the sun coming through and thus charging the cars in a green way.
